# MachineLearning_Project
This project focuses on various Machine learning techniques of regression and classification.
# About 
It Executes an algorithm from scratch using CV through preprocessing, feature engineering and regularization to enhance linear regression models.
Also, diverse classification (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN) and ensemble techniques are applied along with the use of  hyperparameter tuning and CV using scikit-learn for comprehensive analysis on intricate datasets.
# Problem Statement 
To perform ℓ2 regularized ordinary least squares regression, choose regularization constant λ ∈ {10−5, 10−4, 10−3, 10−2, 10−1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000} using a 5-fold crossvalidation on the full train set T1. Use average R2 scores of the folds as the criterion to choose best regularization parameter. Perform ℓ2 regularized ordinary least squares regression with best regularization parameter obtained from the cross-validation procedure on the set T1 and obtain the regression coefficients. Using these coefficients, compute the R2 and mean squared error values on the training set T1 and test set T2.
