# MachineLearning_Project
This project focuses on various Machine learning techniques of regression and classification.
# About 
It Executes an algorithm from scratch using CV through preprocessing, feature engineering and regularization to enhance linear regression models.
Also, diverse classification (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN) and ensemble techniques are applied along with the use of  hyperparameter tuning and CV using scikit-learn for comprehensive analysis on intricate datasets.
